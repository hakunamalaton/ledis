# introduction
Redis is a popular in-memory data structure store that is widely used in many applications, either as cache, complex data structure, or store application data itself.

In this project, I will build a simple stripped down version of Redis named Ledis (for light-weight Redis).

Scope of project:
* Data structures: String, Set
* Special features: Expire, snapshots
* A simple web CLI (similar to redis-cli)
